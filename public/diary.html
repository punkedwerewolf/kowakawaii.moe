      it's been raining...
      <br><br>
            I live in the west, I'm not sure if it's just my state, but we get a season of heavy rains and dust storms. When you disregard the dust storms it's actually really nice. I have my desk positioned by my window, and I get to watch the rain pour down onto the rocks near my house. It's very soothing and gives me the mood stabilization that I need. As I write, I'm actually watching the rain.
	  <br><br>
			It's been a long time since I've relapsed. This is a good thing, obviously, because I'm very prone to slicing myself up. I think this is because I haven't had a favorite person in a month or two, so I have no one to break down over. Let's hope I don't jinx this because I've been happy with my current streak.
